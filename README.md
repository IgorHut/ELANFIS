ELANFIS ( Extreme Learning Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System)

ELANFIS is one of the neuro-fuzzy systems, which combines the learning capabilities of extreme learning machine (ELM) and the explicit knowledge of the fuzzy systems. In ELANFIS, premise parameters are randomly generated with some constraints to accommodate fuzziness, whereas consequent parameters are identified analytically using Moore-Penrose generalized inverse.

For ELANFIS two codes are attached :
1. With normalizing the data
2. Without normalizing the data

Parameters of membership func  a(spread) , c(center) are randomly taken within specified constrained range and b = 2(constant)

No.of epochs = 20
Result with min error is taken .
Results are  quite good :
1. With normalization :  RMSE = 0.0612
2. Without normalization : RMSE =  4.7882
